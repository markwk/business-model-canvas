<h3 id="startup">Startup</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>a series of untested hypothesis and assumptions</p>
</blockquote>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Put another way: <strong>Startups / founders / entrepreneurs exist to deal with uncertainty</strong>.</p>
<p>Steve Blank and other have shown that traditional business management processes and planning developed in MBA programs are not suited for startups, because startups operate in uncertainy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A startup is a temporary organization in search of a scalable, repeatable, profitable business model. (Blank, 2012)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In sharp contrast, startups operate in “search” mode, seeking a repeatable and profitable business model. The search for a business model requires dramatically different rules, roadmaps, skill sets, and tools in order to minimize risk and optimize chances for success. (Blank, 2012)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A mental model is a representation of the world or of how something works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>We cannot keep all the details about something in our brain. Mental models are abstractions and simplifications that helps us deal with complexity by simplifying and reducing the complex stuff into understandable and organized chunks. Models help us think and understand the world. They also shape how we view events, people, situations, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a process to organize the search for a business model, find product-market fit, understand your customers, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<p><small>Originated with Steve Blank and popularized by Eric Reis and Lean Startup. Dovetails well with many aspects of UX. </small></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Steve Blank and others strive to make this an almost scientific process but it still very much an art rather than a purely empirical science.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In practice, startups begin with a set of initial hypotheses (guesses), most of which will end up being wrong. Therefore, focusing on execution and delivering a product or service based on those initial, untested hypotheses is a going-out-of-business strategy.</p>
<p><small>Steve Blank</small></p>

<h3 id="section-2"></h3>
<ul>
<li>Startup founders are optimists. We tend to assume rather than validate.</li>
