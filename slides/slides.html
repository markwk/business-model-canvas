                Steve Blank and other have shown that traditional business
                management processes and planning developed in MBA programs are
                not suited for startups, because startups operate in uncertainy.

                <p>
                  A startup is a temporary organization in search of a scalable,
                  repeatable, profitable business model. (Blank, 2012)

                <p>
                  In sharp contrast, startups operate in “search” mode, seeking
                  a repeatable and profitable business model. The search for a
                  business model requires dramatically different rules,
                  roadmaps, skill sets, and tools in order to minimize risk and
                  optimize chances for success. (Blank, 2012)

                Steve Blank and others strive to make this an almost scientific

                In practice, startups begin with a set of initial hypotheses
                (guesses), most of which will end up being wrong. Therefore,
                focusing on execution and delivering a product or service based
                on those initial, untested hypotheses is a going-out-of-business
                strategy.
